# The F1TENTH Gym environment

This is the repository of the F1TENTH Gym environment.

This project is still under heavy developement.

You can find the [documentation](https://f1tenth-gym.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) of the environment here.

## Quickstart
We recommend installing the simulation inside a virtualenv. You can install the environment by running:

```bash
virtualenv gym_env
source gym_env/bin/activate
git clone https://github.com/f1tenth/f1tenth_gym.git
cd f1tenth_gym
pip install -e .
```

Then you can run a quick waypoint follow example by:
```bash
cd examples
python3 waypoint_follow.py
```
